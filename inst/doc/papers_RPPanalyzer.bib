  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Proteins play a crucial role in biological activity, so
	much can be learned from measuring protein expression and post-translational
	modification quantitatively. The reverse-phase protein lysate arrays
	allow us to quantify the relative expression levels of a protein
	in many different cellular samples simultaneously. Existing approaches
	to quantify protein arrays use parametric response curves fit to
	dilution series data. The results can be biased when the parametric
	function does not fit the data. RESULTS: We propose a non-parametric
	approach which adapts to any monotone response curve. The non-parametric
	approach is shown to be promising via both simulation and real data
	studies; it reduces the bias due to model misspecification and protects
	against outliers in the data. The non-parametric approach enables
	more reliable quantification of protein lysate arrays. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {The advancement of efficient technologies to comply with the needs
	of systems biology and drug discovery has so far not received adequate
	attention. A substantial bottleneck for the time-resolved quantitative
	description of signaling networks is the limited throughput and the
	inadequate sensitivity of currently established methods. Here, we
	present an improved protein microarray-based approach towards the
	sensitive detection of proteins in the fg-range which is based on
	signal detection in the near-infrared range. The high sensitivity
	of the assay permits the specific quantification of proteins derived
	from as little as only 20,000 cells with an error rate of only 5%.
	The capacity is limited to the analysis of up to 500 different samples
	per microarray. Protein abundance is determined qualitatively, and
	quantitatively, if recombinant protein is available. This novel approach
	was called IPAQ (infrared-based protein arrays with quantitative
	readout). IPAQ offers a highly sensitive experimental approach superior
	to the established standard protein quantification technologies,
	and is suitable for quantitative proteomics. Employing the IPAQ approach,
	a detailed analysis of activated signaling networks in biopsy samples
	and of crosstalk between signaling modules as required in drug discovery
	strategies can easily be performed.},

	sensitivity, precision and linearity was achieved, making it possible

	histologically normal prostate epithelium to prostate intraepithelial

	of apoptosis pathways (P<0.03), as well as decreased phosphorylation
	of ERK (P<0.01). At the transition from histologically normal epithelium

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Microarray data must be background corrected to remove
	the effects of non-specific binding or spatial heterogeneity across
	the array, but this practice typically causes other problems such
	as negative corrected intensities and high variability of low intensity
	log-ratios. Different estimators of background, and various model-based
	processing methods, are compared in this study in search of the best
	option for differential expression analyses of small microarray experiments.
	RESULTS: Using data where some independent truth in gene expression
	is known, eight different background correction alternatives are
	compared, in terms of precision and bias of the resulting gene expression
	measures, and in terms of their ability to detect differentially
	expressed genes as judged by two popular algorithms, SAM and limma
	eBayes. A new background processing method (normexp) is introduced
	which is based on a convolution model. The model-based correction
	methods are shown to be markedly superior to the usual practice of
	subtracting local background estimates. Methods which stabilize the
	variances of the log-ratios along the intensity range perform the
	best. The normexp+offset method is found to give the lowest false
	discovery rate overall, followed by morph and vsn. Like vsn, normexp
	is applicable to most types of two-colour microarray data. AVAILABILITY:
	The background correction methods compared in this article are available
	in the R package limma (Smyth, 2005) from http://www.bioconductor.org.

  abstract = {'Reverse-phase' protein lysate microarray (RPA) assays use micro-scale,
	cell lysate dot blots that are printed to a substrate, followed by
	quantitative immunochemical protein detection, known to be particularly
	effective across many samples. Large-scale sample collection is a
	labor-intensive and time-consuming process; the information yielded
	from RPA assays, however, provides unique opportunities to experimentally
	interpret theoretical protein networks quantitatively. When specific
	antibodies are used, RPA can generate 1,000 times more data points
	using 10,000 times less sample volume than an ordinary western blot,
	enabling researchers to monitor quantitative proteomic responses
	for various time-scale and input-dose gradients simultaneously. Hence,
	the RPA system can be an excellent method for experimental validation
	of theoretical protein network models. Besides the initial screening
	of primary antibodies, collection of several hundreds of sample lysates
	from 1- to 8-h periods can be completed in approximately 10 d; subsequent

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {555},
  month = {Jan},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) are convenient assay
	platforms to investigate the presence of biomarkers in tissue lysates.
	As with other high-throughput technologies, substantial amounts of
	analytical data are generated. Over 1,000 samples may be printed
	on a single nitrocellulose slide. Up to 100 different proteins may
	be assessed using immunoperoxidase or immunoflorescence techniques
	in order to determine relative amounts of protein expression in the
	samples of interest. RESULTS: In this report an RPPA Information
	Management System (RIMS) is described and made available with open
	source software. In order to implement the proposed system, we propose
	a metadata format known as reverse phase protein array markup language
	(RPPAML). RPPAML would enable researchers to describe, document and
	disseminate RPPA data. The complexity of the data structure needed
	to describe the results and the graphic tools necessary to visualize
	them require a software deployment distributed between a client and
	a server application. This was achieved without sacrificing interoperability
	between individual deployments through the use of an open source
	semantic database, S3DB. This data service backbone is available
	to multiple client side applications that can also access other server
	side deployments. The RIMS platform was designed to interoperate
	with other data analysis and data visualization tools such as Cytoscape.
	CONCLUSION: The proposed RPPAML data format hopes to standardize
	RPPA data. Standardization of data would result in diverse client
	applications being able to operate on the same set of data. Additionally,
	having data in a standard format would enable data dissemination
	and data analysis.},

  abstract = {Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) are a powerful high throughput
	tool for measuring protein concentrations in a large number of samples.
	In RPPA technology, the original samples are often diluted successively
	multiple times, forming dilution series to extend the dynamic range
	of the measurements and to increase confidence in quantitation. An
	RPPA experiment is equivalent to running multiple ELISA assays concurrently
	except that there usually is no known protein concentration from
	which one can construct a standard re-sponse curve. Here we describe
	a new method called "serial dilution curve for RPPA data analysis".
	Compared with the existing methods, the new method has the advantage
	of using fewer parameters and offering a simple way of visualizing
	the raw data. We showed how the method can be used to examine data
	quality and to obtain ro-bust quantification of protein concentrations.
